A Very simple side scroller game made with C++ 11 and allegro game library.

# Interesting stuff in this game

-I used Dijkstra algorithm for enemies to find the shortest path in a map.
-I used C++ STL and Range-base for loops which is a C++ feature.

# Limitations

Dijkstra algorithm cannot process for more than two enemies.I will work on it to make it more fast so it can process
more than two enemies.

#Bugs

Yup! This game has couple of bugs which can be easily observed.

# Compilation of code

Make sure you have visual studio 2012 installed in your computer.
copy the allegro and load runner file in your visual studio 2012/projects folder and just open the project and compile it.
