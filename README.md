A Very simple side scroller game made with C++ 11 and allegro 5 game library.

# Interesting stuff in this game

-I used Dijkstra algorithm for enemies to find the shortest path in a map.
-I used C++ STL and Some C++ 11 features

# Limitations

Dijkstra algorithm is not fully optimized.

#Bugs

Yup! This game has couple of bugs which can be easily observed.

# Compilation of code

Make sure you have visual studio 2012 installed in your computer.
copy the allegro and load runner file in your visual studio 2012/projects folder and just open the project and compile it.
